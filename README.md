# Relationships Between Penstions and Health Status
This document tries to find any meaningful relationships between the level of education, the health status and the financial status of a sample of a survey of pensioners in Bulgaria. The data is provided by the World bank. One way, two way ANOVA as well as kruskalâ€“wallis statistical non parametric test have been used.
All the test show that there is a relationship between the variables and the pension. More work is needed to determine the strength and way of the relationship.
